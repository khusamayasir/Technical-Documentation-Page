        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. </p>
        <p>Some of the <b>features & key-points</b> to note about the programming language are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Simple:</b> 
            <p>It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich
              library support and a variety of data-types.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent:</b>
            <p>A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are
              machine independent.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Mid-level language: </b>
            <p>It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build
              large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rich library support:</b>
            <p>Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries
              (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.
              Speed of execution: C++ programs excel in execution speed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Speed of execution:</b>
            <p>C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages
              have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the
              program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pointer and direct Memory-Access:</b>
            <p>C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level
              programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Object-Oriented:</b>
            <p>One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make
              maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to
              maintain as code-size grows.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compiled Language:</b>
            <p>C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>
          All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we can say that
          data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the
          compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declared. Every data type
          requires a different amount of memory.
          C++ supports a wide variety of data types and the programmer can select the data type appropriate to the needs of the
          application. Data types specify the size and types of value to be stored. However, storage representation and machine
          instructions to manipulate each data type differ from machine to machine, although C++ instructions are identical on
          all machines.
        </p>
        <p>C++ supports the following data types:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Primary or Built in or Fundamental data type
          </li>
          <li>
            Derived data types
          </li>
          <li>
            User defined data types
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Data types in C++ are mainly divided into three types:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Primitive Data Types:</b>
            <p>
              These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables.
              example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Integer
              </li>
              <li>
                Character
              </li>
              <li>
                Boolean
              </li>
              <li>
                Floating Point
              </li>
              <li>
                Double Floating Point
              </li>
              <li>
                Valueless or Void
              </li>
              <li>
                Wide Character
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <b>Derived Data Types:</b>
            <p>The data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as
              Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Function
              </li>
              <li>
                Array
              </li>
              <li>
                Pointer
              </li>
              <li>
                Reference
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <b>Abstract or User-Defined Data Types:</b>
            <p>These data types are defined by the user itself. Like, as defining a class in
              C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Class

        <p>
          In Loop, the statement needs to be written only once and the loop will be executed 10 times as shown below. In computer
          programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached.
          An operation is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as
          whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.
          <b>
            There are mainly two types of loops:
          </b>
        <p>
          <b>>Entry Controlled loops:</b> In this type of loop, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For Loop and
          While Loop is entry-controlled loops.
          <b>Exit Controlled Loops:</b> In this type of loop the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body.
          Therefore, the loop body will execute at least once, irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. the
          do-while loop is exit controlled loop.

                – firstly initializes, then, condition check, execute body, update. – A for loop is a repetition control
                structure that allows us to write a loop that is executed a specific number of times.
                The loop enables us to perform n number of steps together in one line.
                <code>
                  for (initialization expr; test expr; update expr)
                  {    
                       // body of the loop
                       // statements we want to execute
                  }
                  <p>
                    Example:
                  </p>
                  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
                  {
                
                  }
                </code>
                  In for loop, a loop variable is used to control the loop. First, initialize this loop variable to some value,
                  then
                  check whether this variable is less than or greater than the counter value. If the statement is true, then the
                  loop
                  body is executed and the loop variable gets updated. Steps are repeated till the exit condition comes.
          
                  <b>
                    Initialization Expression:
                  </b>
                  In this expression, we have to initialize the loop counter to some value. for example: int i=1;
                  Test Expression: In this expression, we have to test the condition. If the condition evaluates to true then we
                  will
                  execute the body of the loop and go to update expression otherwise we will exit from the for a loop. For
                  example: i <= 10; Update Expression: After executing the loop body this expression increments/decrements the loop variable by some value. for example: i++; Equivalent Flow Diagram for loop
