        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. </p>
        <p>Some of the <b>features & key-points</b> to note about the programming language are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Simple:</b> 
            It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent:</b>
             A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Mid-level language: </b>
            It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rich library support:</b>
            Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.
            Speed of execution: C++ programs excel in execution speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Speed of execution:</b>
            C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pointer and direct Memory-Access:</b>
            C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Object-Oriented:</b>
            One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compiled Language:</b>
            C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.
          </li>
        </ul>
