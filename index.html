        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. </p>
        <p>Some of the <b>features & key-points</b> to note about the programming language are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Simple:</b> 
            It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent:</b>
             A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux wonâ€™t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Mid-level language: </b>
            It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rich library support:</b>
            Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.
            Speed of execution: C++ programs excel in execution speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Speed of execution:</b>
            C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pointer and direct Memory-Access:</b>
            C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Object-Oriented:</b>
            One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to maintain as code-size grows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compiled Language:</b>
            C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>
          All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we can say that
          data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the
          compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declared. Every data type
          requires a different amount of memory.
          C++ supports a wide variety of data types and the programmer can select the data type appropriate to the needs of the
          application. Data types specify the size and types of value to be stored. However, storage representation and machine
          instructions to manipulate each data type differ from machine to machine, although C++ instructions are identical on
          all machines.
        </p>
        <p>C++ supports the following data types:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Primary or Built in or Fundamental data type
          </li>
          <li>
            Derived data types
          </li>
          <li>
            User defined data types
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
          </li>
          <li>
            In C++, all the variables must be declared before use.
