        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. </p>
        <p>Some of the <b>features & key-points</b> to note about the programming language are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Simple:</b> 
            <p>It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich
              library support and a variety of data-types.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Machine Independent but Platform Dependent:</b>
            <p>A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are
              machine independent.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Mid-level language: </b>
            <p>It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build
              large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Rich library support:</b>
            <p>Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries
              (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.
              Speed of execution: C++ programs excel in execution speed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Speed of execution:</b>
            <p>C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages
              have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the
              program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pointer and direct Memory-Access:</b>
            <p>C++ provides pointer support which aids users to directly manipulate storage address. This helps in doing low-level
              programming (where one might need to have explicit control on the storage of variables).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Object-Oriented:</b>
            <p>One of the strongest points of the language which sets it apart from C. Object-Oriented support helps C++ to make
              maintainable and extensible programs. i.e. Large-scale applications can be built. Procedural code becomes difficult to
              maintain as code-size grows.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compiled Language:</b>
            <p>C++ is a compiled language, contributing to its speed.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <header>Data Types</header>
        <p>
          All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we can say that
          data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the
          compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declared. Every data type
          requires a different amount of memory.
          C++ supports a wide variety of data types and the programmer can select the data type appropriate to the needs of the
          application. Data types specify the size and types of value to be stored. However, storage representation and machine
          instructions to manipulate each data type differ from machine to machine, although C++ instructions are identical on
          all machines.
        </p>
        <p>C++ supports the following data types:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Primary or Built in or Fundamental data type
          </li>
          <li>
            Derived data types
          </li>
          <li>
            User defined data types
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          Data types in C++ are mainly divided into three types:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Primitive Data Types:</b>
            <p>
              These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables.
              example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Integer
              </li>
              <li>
                Character
              </li>
              <li>
                Boolean
              </li>
              <li>
                Floating Point
              </li>
              <li>
                Double Floating Point
              </li>
              <li>
                Valueless or Void
              </li>
              <li>
                Wide Character
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        
          <li>
            <b>Derived Data Types:</b>
            <p>The data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as
              Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Function
              </li>
              <li>
                Array
              </li>
              <li>
                Pointer

          </li>
        
          <li>
            <b>Abstract or User-Defined Data Types:</b>
            <p>These data types are defined by the user itself. Like, as defining a class in
              C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Class

        <p>
          In Loop, the statement needs to be written only once and the loop will be executed 10 times as shown below. In computer
          programming, a loop is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is reached.
          An operation is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as
          whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.
          <b>
            There are mainly two types of loops:
          </b>
        <p>
          <b>>Entry Controlled loops:</b> In this type of loop, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For Loop and
          While Loop is entry-controlled loops.
          <b>Exit Controlled Loops:</b> In this type of loop the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body.
          Therefore, the loop body will execute at least once, irrespective of whether the test condition is true or false. the
          do-while loop is exit controlled loop.

                – firstly initializes, then, condition check, execute body, update. – A for loop is a repetition control
                structure that allows us to write a loop that is executed a specific number of times.
                The loop enables us to perform n number of steps together in one line.

                <p>
                  In for loop, a loop variable is used to control the loop. First, initialize this loop variable to some value, then
                  check whether this variable is less than or greater than the counter value. If the statement is true, then the loop
                  body is executed and the loop variable gets updated. Steps are repeated till the exit condition comes.
                  <b>
                    Initialization Expression:

                  <p>
                    In this expression, we have to initialize the loop counter to some value. for example: int i=1;

                  <p>
                    In this expression, we have to test the condition. If the condition evaluates to true then we will execute the body of the loop
                  and go to update expression otherwise we will exit from the for a loop. For example: i<= 10; 
                  </p>

                  the loop body is needed to be executed is known to us. while loops are used in situations where we do not know the
                  exact number of iterations of the loop beforehand. The loop execution is terminated on the basis of the test

        <p>
          There come situations in real life when we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions, we decide what should we do next. Similar situations arise in programming also where we need to make some decisions and based on these decisions we will execute the next block of code. For example, in C if x occurs then execute y else execute z. There can also be multiple conditions like in C if x occurs then execute p, else if condition y occurs execute q, else execute r. This condition of C else-if is one of the many ways of importing multiple conditions.

              if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statement is executed otherwise not.

              The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it won’t. But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. Here comes the C else statement. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.

          <p>
            A nested if in C is an if statement that is the target of another if statement. Nested if statements mean an if statement inside another if statement. Yes, both C and C++ allow us to nested if statements within if statements, i.e, we can place an if statement inside another if statement.

        <p>
          Operators are the foundation of any programming language. We can define operators as symbols that help us to perform specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words, we can say that an operator operates the operands. For example, ‘+’ is an operator used for addition, as shown below:  
          c = a + b;
          Here, ‘+’ is the operator known as the addition operator and ‘a’ and ‘b’ are operands. The addition operator tells the compiler to add both of the operands ‘a’ and ‘b’. 
          The functionality of the C/C++ programming language is incomplete without the use of operators.
          C/C++ has many built-in operators and can be classified into 6 types.
          3 Main types are:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Arithmetic Operators
            </li>

              Relational Operators
            </li>
            <li>
              Logical Operators
            </li>

            These operators are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. Examples: (+, -, *, /, %,++,–). Arithmetic operators are of two types:

                <p>
                  Operators that operate or work with two operands are binary operators. For example: Addition(+), Subtraction(-), multiplication(*), Division(/) operators

            Relational Operators:
          </b>
          <p>
            These are used for the comparison of the values of two operands. For example, checking if one operand is equal to the other operand or not, whether an operand is greater than the other operand or not, etc. Some of the relational operators are (==, >= , <= )(See this article for more reference).
          </p>
          <code>
            int a = 3;
            int b = 5;
            a < b;
            // operator to check if a is smaller than b

            <b>
              Logical Operators:
            </b>
            <p>
              Logical Operators are used to combine two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition in consideration. The result of the operation of a logical operator is a Boolean value either true or false. 
              For example, the logical AND represented as ‘&&’ operator in C or C++ returns true when both the conditions under consideration are satisfied. Otherwise, it returns false. Therefore, a && b returns true when both a and b are true (i.e. non-zero)(See this article for more reference).

              (4 != 5) && (4 < 5);     // true
